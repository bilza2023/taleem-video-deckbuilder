OK let me lock some thing in and please give me answer on each

1: The showAt data is for player and not for DrawEngine . The DrawEngine just draw all it gets does not know about time and is dumb. If Player does not want something to be drawn it is removed by Player.

2: "SHOWAT" is now a core feature of this library just like "SLIDES" . Previously the library was

----- > slide -> animate items --> show
now
------> slide -> get only visible items -> animate items ->show

3: In 1 line this library in its current state: - show slides based on shart and end time. - each slide is bundle of items which show on their respective showAt - the animations are mildly used if needed as effects. - We provide some basic presets which are corec of the lib and let users to wrap this solid core

Locked and confirmed. Here are answers point-by-point:

---

**1: ✅ Correct and locked**
`showAt` is **only for the Player**.
`DrawEngine` must be **completely dumb** — it only knows: *“Draw this item.”*
Player filters items based on time (`currentTime >= slide.startTime + item.showAt`) before sending to draw.

---

**2: ✅ Correct — `showAt` is now core**
`showAt` is now a **fundamental timing contract**, just like `slide.startTime`.
Old flow:

> slide → animate items → show
> New flow:
> slide → **filter visible items** → animate if needed → draw

This improves **data control**, **debuggability**, and **performance**.

---

**3: ✅ Approved summary of the system**

> In 1 line this library in its current state:
> **The system renders slides based on their start/end time; each slide contains items that appear at `showAt` timestamps, with light optional animations layered over a predictable timeline. Presets are external and wrap this stable core.**

No fluff. Just system-first clarity.

If you want, I can now prep the `Player.render()` patch to implement this clean logic. Just say `code`.
